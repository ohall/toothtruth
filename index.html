      <p>In a revelation that has turned bedtime traditions upside down, scientists at the Folklore Research Institute announced on Tuesday that the Tooth Fairy now prefers children to leave their lost teeth in a glass jar or cup in the kitchen rather than under their pillow.</p>
      <p>The study, which monitored Tooth Fairy deposit patterns across 3,000 households, indicates that the mythical creature favors the stability and visibility of glass containers. "We were astonished to discover this trend," said Dr. Harriet Whittle, lead researcher. "Glass jars offer an optimal balance of accessibility and security for the Tooth Fairy."</p>
      <p>Experts suggest that placing teeth in a clear jar not only helps the Tooth Fairy locate the offerings but also allows parents to track their child's dental milestones. "It's a win-win," said Dr. Whittle. "Kids can see their collection grow, and the Tooth Fairy can do her rounds with greater efficiency."</p>
      <p>As a result of the findings, the Folklore Research Institute recommends parents prepare a dedicated glass or ceramic container on the kitchen counter. While some purists may lament the departure from tradition, most families are reported to be embracing the new practice.</p>
      <p>"It's fun to have a little display," said Angela Martinez, mother of two. "My kids love showing off their jars to friends."</p>
      <p>Whether this change in ritual will become a permanent fixture of Tooth Fairy lore remains to be seen, but for now, scientists and children alike seem to agree: out with the pillow, in with the jar.</p>
